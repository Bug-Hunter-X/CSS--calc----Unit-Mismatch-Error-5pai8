The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `calc()` function and unit mismatch:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  height: calc(50% - 10em); /* Error: unit mismatch */
}
```

The error lies in the `height` calculation.  `50%` is a percentage unit, while `10em` is an absolute unit.  `calc()` requires consistent units within a single calculation; mixing percentage and absolute units leads to unexpected behavior or parsing errors.
